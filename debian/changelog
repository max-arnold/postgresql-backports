  * New upstream bugfix release.

    + Fix "VACUUM"'s tests to see whether it can update relfrozenxid
      (Andres Freund)

      In some cases "VACUUM" (either manual or autovacuum) could
      incorrectly advance a table's relfrozenxid value, allowing tuples
      to escape freezing, causing those rows to become invisible once
      2^31 transactions have elapsed. The probability of data loss is
      fairly low since multiple incorrect advancements would need to
      happen before actual loss occurs, but it's not zero. In 9.2.0 and
      later, the probability of loss is higher, and it's also possible to
      get "could not access status of transaction" errors as a
      consequence of this bug. Users upgrading from releases 9.0.4 or
      8.4.8 or earlier are not affected, but all later versions contain
      the bug.
      The issue can be ameliorated by, after upgrading, vacuuming all
      tables in all databases while having vacuum_freeze_table_age set to
      zero. This will fix any latent corruption but will not be able to
      fix all pre-existing data errors. However, an installation can be
      presumed safe after performing this vacuuming if it has executed
      fewer than 2^31 update transactions in its lifetime (check this
      with SELECT txid_current() < 2^31).

    + Fix multiple bugs in MultiXactId freezing (Andres Freund, Alvaro
      Herrera)

      These bugs could lead to "could not access status of transaction"
      errors, or to duplicate or vanishing rows. Users upgrading from
      releases prior to 9.3.0 are not affected.
      The issue can be ameliorated by, after upgrading, vacuuming all
      tables in all databases while having vacuum_freeze_table_age set to
      zero. This will fix latent corruption but will not be able to fix
      all pre-existing data errors.
      As a separate issue, these bugs can also cause standby servers to
      get out of sync with the primary, thus exhibiting data errors that
      are not in the primary. Therefore, it's recommended that 9.3.0 and
      9.3.1 standby servers be re-cloned from the primary (e.g., with a
      new base backup) after upgrading.

    + Fix initialization of "pg_clog" and "pg_subtrans" during hot
      standby startup (Andres Freund, Heikki Linnakangas)

      This bug can cause data loss on standby servers at the moment they
      start to accept hot-standby queries, by marking committed
      transactions as uncommitted. The likelihood of such corruption is
      small unless, at the time of standby startup, the primary server
      has executed many updating transactions since its last checkpoint.
      Symptoms include missing rows, rows that should have been deleted
      being still visible, and obsolete versions of updated rows being
      still visible alongside their newer versions.
      This bug was introduced in versions 9.3.0, 9.2.5, 9.1.10, and
      9.0.14. Standby servers that have only been running earlier
      releases are not at risk. It's recommended that standby servers
      that have ever run any of the buggy releases be re-cloned from the
      primary (e.g., with a new base backup) after upgrading.
